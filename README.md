# apacseng_2025_design_workshop

The third attempt at design is indeed challenging. In fact, the third time doing anything is difficult, as it means pushing beyond previous boundaries. Although AIGC models have advanced further, with the well-known __Flux__ being a prime example, there hasn’t been significant progress in generating customized design drafts. 

I wasn't able to successfully generate the latest Model 3/Y or Cybertruck because AIGC's memory is too strong. While it can generate different styles of artwork based on the new models, once multiple elements start to combine and __"generate together"__, the results always become distorted and eventually converge toward older models—no matter how I adjust the temperature. This limitation is inherent to the generative model itself.

To sum up, you might find this time a little disappointing.

Due to a __tight schedule__, I didn’t experiment with too many models this time. I tried __Flux__, but the results didn’t seem promising—perhaps because I wasn’t using a more powerful version of Flux, as I had limited credits left. __DALL·E 2/3__ continues to deliver impressive performance. Moreover, it seems that this year is more about __large model distillation__ rather than AIGC advancements.

I previously mentioned that I uploaded the designs to a public Git repository—not just for editing by third parties, but more importantly, so that my colleagues could access them from anywhere. It turned out to be prophetic; last year, many outstanding colleagues left us. I will continue to upload the designs to the public Git repository as a way to express my remembrance of them.

## Raw pics

Please check the following pics. Raw pictures are the very raw design we got from AIGC and our group votes to use. I have written some comments to each pic to make it easier for you to vote.

Please note that the raw pictures are quite large, so please be patient with the loading time.
